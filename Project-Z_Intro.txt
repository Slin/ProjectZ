Humanity is doomed! A virus outbreak has been killing off thousands, slowly dissolving people into toxic sludge that still seeks to infect others. You can still hear the panicked screams of your neighbors in your mind. You remember slowly advancing gelatinous cubes hunting people into corners. It would have been hilarious had not been so deadly. You had run outside and then... The last thing you remember is some military guys grabbing you and pushing you into a truck.
